```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Circle inside Square</title>
  </head>
  <style>
    .rectangle {    
        border-radius: 10px;
        display: inline-block;
        width: 205px;
        height: 205px;
        border: 1px solid #000;

    }
    .rectangle:before {
        display: block;
        position: absolute;
        left: 10px;
        top: 10px;
        content: '';

    }
    </style>
    <body>
        <div class="rectangle"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

#### Q. What are the css Selectors? 

The way you declare which elements the styles should apply to. There are different kinds of selectors:

* ```Class```: The most commonly used selector. E.g. “.cloudy” to select an element with classname cloudy. There can be more than 1 element with the same classname.

* ```ID```: Use this sparingly. You cannot reuse an ID within the same page and used only to identify an element uniquely. E.g. ```<div id=lovelyweather></div>```

* ```Attribute Selector```: If you use any attribute other than class or id to identify an element in a stylesheet, you would be using Attribute Selectors. You can also do basic pattern matching within an attribute selector (so if you would like to do basic pattern matching for selectors using class or ID attributes, you would want to use attribute selectors).

* ```Pseudo-Classes```: Classes that are applied to elements based on information that is not present in the markup, e.g. :first-child or :last-child. Do note that the selectors are parsed from right to left (see the demo). You cannot use section ```article:first-child``` to select the first occurrence of article, if the first child of section is h1 and not article. Likewise with the :nth-child, and :last-child pseudo-classes.

* ```Pseudo-Elements```: Pseudo-elements differ from Pseudo-Classes in that they actually create an element in the document tree. This is almost the first instance of CSS modifying the HTML document tree. You should ideally use pseudo-elements with “::” instead of “:” (but most browsers accept “:” notation for CSS 2.1 pseudo-elements). Pseudo-elements are: ```::first-line```, ```::first-letter```, ```::before```, ```::after``` (See the demo for how pseudo-elements work).
        

#### Q. What are Combinators?

The selection of an element based on its occurrence in relation to another element (chosen by the choice of combinator: whitespace, >, +, or ~). You can have:

* Descendant Combinator
    * This is the most common usage, e.g. #lovelyweather h1.
* Child Combinator
    * Select an element if it is a direct child of another element (and not a grandchild of that element).
* Adjacent Sibling Combinator
    * The element that is immediately adjacent to another element.
* General Sibling Combinator
    * The element that is adjacent, but not immediately to another element.
        


#### Q. What is the difference between class selectors and id selectors?
An overall block is given to class selector while id selectors take only a single element differing from other element
  

#### Q. When working on a large codebase CSS it can quickly become unwieldly and difficult to maintain. How do you approach this problem? How do you architect your CSS (and have you used BEM, OOCS or SMACSS)?    
    

#### Q. What is CSS BEM?

The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for `Block Element Modifier` which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a "namespace" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.

```css
/* block component */
.block {
}

/* element */
.block__element {
}

/* modifier */
.block__element--modifier {
}

```

Here is an example with the class names on markup:

```css
<nav class="navbar">
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link navbar__link--active"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
</nav>

```

In this case, ```navbar``` is the Block, ```navbar__link``` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the navbar component, and ```navbar__link--active``` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the ```navbar__link``` Element.

Since Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use ```is-*``` flags instead as modifiers.

```css
<a href="/" class="navbar__link is-active"></a>
```

These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.

```css
.navbar__link.is-active {
}

```


#### Q. Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site. How do you go about creating them? What are possible alternatives to sprites?    
    
CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is a commonly-used technique for icons. How to implement it:

* Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.
* Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.
* To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.

**Advantages:**

* Reduce the number of ```HTTP``` requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with ```HTTP2```, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.
* Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.


* When you have multiple images/ icons, browser makes separate call to the server for each one of them. sprite is a technique to combine all/ some of them (usually similar one in terms of type of image. For example, you will put jpg in one sprite) in one image. To display the icon you set height, width and background position.

**Alternatives:**

* Data URIs - allow you to embed the image data directly into a stylesheet. This avoids additional HTTP requests for images, making it essentially the same thing as a sprite, without the fancy positioning.

* Icon Fonts

* SVGs


#### Q. What are the benefits of CSS sprites?
If a web page has large no. of images that takes a longer time to load because each image separately sends out an ```HTTP``` request. The concept of CSS sprites is used to reduce the loading time for a web page because it combines the various small images into one image. It reduces the number of ```HTTP``` requests and hence the loading time. 
    
CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.

Under HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.

However, according to benchmark results, although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.

To utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as ```background-image```, ```background-position``` and ```background-size``` to ultimately alter the background of an element.


#### Q. What is the float property and what float do?
* The CSS float property is used to move the image to the right or left along with the texts to be wrapped around it. It doesn't change the property of the elements used before it

* float pushes an element to the sides of a page with text wrapped around it. you can create entire page or a smaller area by using float. if size of a floated element changes, text around it will re-flow to accommodate the changes. You can have float left, right, none or inherit.

* if you set, 'float: left;' for an image, it will move to the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level element is reached. The normal flow will wrap around on the right side.  


#### Q. How can you clear sides of a floating element?

If you clear a slide of an element, floating elements will not be accepted on that side. With 'clear' set to 'left', an element will be moved below any floating element on the left side. clear is used to stop wrap of an element around a floating element.


#### Q. What is tweening?

* It is the process of generating intermediate frames between two images.

* It gives the impression that the first image has smoothly evolved into the second one.

* It is an important method used in all types of animations.

* In CSS3, Transforms (matrix, translate, rotate, scale etc.) module can be used to achieve tweening.


#### Q. Who maintains the CSS specifications? What do you understand by W3C?
W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant protocols and guidelines.This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing Web standards. By adopting the Web standards created by the W3C, hardware manufacturers and software developers can ensure their equipment and programs work with the latest Web technologies. For example, most Web browsers incorporate several W3C standards, which allows them to interpret the latest versions of HTML and CSS code. When browsers conform to the W3C standards, it also helps Web pages appear consistent across different browsers.


#### Q. Explain the difference between ```visibility: hidden;``` and ```display: none;```? What are the pros and cons of using ```display:none```?

* ```visibility: hidden``` simply hides the element but it will occupy space and affect the layout of the document.

* ```display: none``` removes the element from the normal layout flow (causes DOM reflow). It will not affect the layout of the document nor occupy space.


#### Q. What is re-flow?

* Reflow is the name of the web browser process for re-calculating the positions and geometries of elements in the document, for the purpose of re-rendering part or all of the document.

* Reflow occurs when you:

    1. insert, remove or update an element in the DOM
    1. modify content on the page, e.g. the text in an input box
    1. move a DOM element
    1. animate a DOM element
    1. take measurements of an element such as offsetHeight or getComputedStyle
    1. change a CSS style
    1. change the className of an element
    1. add or remove a stylesheet
    1. resize the window
    1. scroll


#### Q. How does ```z-index``` relate to positioning? Describe ```z-index``` and how stacking context is formed?
* The ```z-index``` property specifies the stack order of elements. An element with a higher ```z-index``` stack order is always rendered in front of an element with a lower ```z-index``` stack order on the screen. ```z-index``` only works on positioned elements ```position: absolute```, ```position: relative```, or ```position: fixed```. The default stack order of non-positioned elements is their order in the document.
    

#### Q. What is the purpose of the ```z-index``` and how is it used?

* The ```z-index``` helps specify the stack order of positioned elements that may overlap one another. The ```z-index``` default value is zero, and can take on either a positive or negative number.

* An element with a higher ```z-index``` is always stacked above than a lower index.

* ```z-index``` can take the following values:

   * Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
   * Number: Orders the stack order.
   * Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).
   * Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.


#### Q. How works absolute / relative / fixed / static position? 

```absolute```, place an element exactly where you want to place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. if no parent available then relatively place to the page itself (it will default all the way back up to the <html> element).

```relative```, means "relative to itself". Setting position: relative; on an element and no other positioning attributes, it will no effect on it's positioning. It allows the use of ```z-index``` on the element and it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block.

```fixed```, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't changed if u scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.

* ```static``` default for every single page element. The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control.


* ```sticky``` - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as `relative` positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as `fixed` positioned.


#### Q. The difference between block / inline / inline-block element?
    
* Elements with ```display: inline-block``` are like ```display: inline elements```, but they can have a width and a height. 
    That means that you can use an ```inline-block``` element as a block while flowing it within text or other elements.
    
* ```block```:
    * respect all of those
    * force a line break after the block element
    * breaks the flow
        
* ```inline```:
    * respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
    * cannot have a width and height set
    * margin and padding will push other elements horizontally not vertically
    * allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
    * elements do not break the flow
        
* ```inline-block```:
    * allow other elements to sit to their left and right
    * respect top & bottom margins and padding
    * respect height and width


#### Q. What are counters in CSS3?

* CSS counters let you adjust the appearance of content based on its location in a document. 

* To use a CSS counter, it must first be initialized to a value with the counter-reset property (0 by default). The same property can also be used to change its value to any specific number. Once initialized, a counter's value can be increased or decreased with counter-increment. The counter's name must not be "none", "inherit", or "initial"; otherwise the declaration is ignored.

* **CSS**

```css
body {
  counter-reset: section;                       /* Set a counter named 'section', and its initial value is 0. */
}

h3::before {
  counter-increment: section;                   /* Increment the value of section counter by 1 */
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": ";    /* Display the word 'Section ', the value of 
                                                   section counter, and a colon before the content
                                                   of each h3 */
}


```

* **HTML**

```html
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h3>Body</h3>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

```

#### Q. Are CSS rule names case sensitive?

* No


#### Q. Does margin-top or margin-bottom has effect on inline element?

* No


#### Q. Does padding-top or padding-bottom has effect on inline element?

* No


#### Q. Which one would you prefer among px, em % or pt and why?

* ```px``` gives fine grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px is guaranteed to look sharp. px is not cascade, this means if parent font-size is 20px and child 16px. child would be 16px.

* ```em``` maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. em is the width of the letter 'm' in the selected typeface. However, this concept is tricky. 1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. if u sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px. The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px). em is cascade

* ```%``` sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. Hence, you have to set font-size of the body to a reasonable size. this is easy to use and does cascade. for example, if parent font-size is 20px and child font-size is 50%. child would be 10px.

* ```pt```(points) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is fixed-size unit.


#### Q. Does padding-left or padding-right or margin-left or margin-right has effect on inline element?

* Yes


#### Q. Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pseudo-elements

* A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

    Style the first letter, or line, of an element
    Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

```css
p::first-line {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
```

#### Q. In a HTML document the pseudo class :root always refers to the html element?
* True

#### Q. What is pseudo element? what is pseudo class?
* pseudo elements helps you to add cosmetics contents. pseudo elements generates content where as pseudo class deals with state of the element. for example, you can style ```:first-letter``` of every paragraph. similarly, ```:first-line``` and fancy stuff with ```:before```, ```:after```

#### Q. The pseudo class :checked will select inputs with type radio or checkbox, but not <option> elements.
* False

#### Q. How to center align a div inside another div?
```css
.container{
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	background-color: red;
	position: absolute;
	top:0;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	margin: auto;
}

```

#### Q. Explain the CSS “box model” and the layout components that it consists of. Provide some usage examples.
The CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:

* **Content**: The content of the box, where text and images appear
* **Padding**: A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content)
* **Border**: A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content
* **Margin**: A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements)

    ```css
    /* top   right  bottom left  */
    padding: 25px  50px   75px   100px;
    
    /* same padding on all 4 sides: */
    padding: 25px;
    
    /* top/bottom padding 25px; right/left padding 50px */
    padding: 25px 50px;
    
    /* top padding 25px; right/left padding 50px; bottom padding 75px */
    padding: 25px 50px 75px;
    ```

#### Q. Explain what elements will match each of the following CSS selectors:
* div, ```p``` Selects all ```<div>``` elements and all <p> elements
* div ```p``` Selects all ```<p>``` elements that are anywhere inside a <div> element
* div > ```p``` Selects all ```<p>``` elements where the immediate parent is a <div> element
* div + ```p``` Selects all ```<p>``` elements that are placed immediately after a <div> element
* div ~ ```p``` Selects all ```<p>``` elements that are anywhere preceded by a <div> element


#### Q. Explain the meaning of each of these CSS units for expressing length:
```cm``` centimeters
```em``` elements (i.e., relative to the font-size of the element; e.g., 2 em means 2 times the current font size)
```in``` inches
```mm``` millimeters
```pc``` picas (1 pc = 12 pt = 1/6th of an inch)
```pt``` points (1 pt = 1/72nd of an inch)
```px``` pixels (1 px = 1/96th of an inch)


#### Q. In CSS3, how would you select:

* Every ```<a>``` element whose href attribute value begins with “https”.
    * a[href^="https"]
    
* Every ```<a>``` element whose href attribute value ends with “.pdf”.
    * a[href$=".pdf"]
    
* Every ```<a>``` element whose href attribute value contains the substring “css”.
    * a[href*="css"]


#### Q. What is the purpose of the box-sizing property?

The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

1. **content-box**: the default. Width and height values apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the outside of the box.
1. **padding-box**: Width and height values apply to the element's content and its padding. The border is added to the outside of the box. Currently, only Firefox supports the padding-box value.
1. **border-box**: Width and height values apply to the content, padding, and border.
1. **inherit**: inherits the box sizing of the parent element.

Example:
```css
box-sizing: content-box;
width: 100%;
border: solid rgb(90,107,204) 10px;
padding: 5px;
```

#### Q. How to create a zebra striped table with CSS?

To create a zebra-striped table, use the nth-child() selector and add a background-color to all even (or odd) table rows:

```css
tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #f2f2f2
}
```

#### Q. What is the difference between RGBa, HEX and HSLa?

* **RGB** or Red/Green/Blue is a color model.

```css
p {
  color: rgba(37, 84, 127, 1);
}
```
* **HEX**

```css
p {
  color: #25547f;
}
```

* **HSLa (Hue Saturation Lightness alpha)**

```css
p {
  color: hsla(209, 55%, 32%, 1);
}
```

#### Q. What is CSS preprocessor and why to user one?
* A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

* Here are a few of the most popular CSS preprocessors:

    * SASS (SCSS)
    * LESS
    * Stylus
    * PostCSS

#### Q. What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?

**Advantages:**

* CSS is made more maintainable.
* Easy to write nested selectors.
* Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.
* Mixins to generate repeated CSS.
* Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.
* Advantages of SASS/LESS: Use of variables, mixins, nesting, looping, partials and more.
* Advantages POSTCSS: Use of future syntax. Ability to select only the plugins you need for a particular project. Writing plain CSS and applying the plugin to output necessary syntax that suits your needs – which in turn allows for the ability to remove or update that plugin if at any time it is not useful anymore. In other words, POSTCSS offers a lot of flexibility AND all of the features SASS/LESS offer. Versions of POSTCSS have been developed for both Grunt and Gulp.
* Disadvantage POSTCSS: Keeping track of plugins for older projects could get hairy, though you have a package.json to reference.
* Disdvantages of SASS/LESS: They are monolithic, and you need to learn a new language.


#### Q. What is the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
* Resetting - Resetting is meant to strip all default browser styling on elements. For e.g. margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same. You will have to redeclare styling for common typographic elements.

* Normalizing - Normalizing preserves useful default styles rather than "unstyling" everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.


#### Q. Describe Floats and how they work.

Float is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which are removed from the flow of the page.

The CSS `clear` property can be used to be positioned below `left`/`right`/`both` floated elements.

If a parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing. It can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.

The `.clearfix` hack uses a clever CSS [pseudo selector](#describe-pseudo-elements-and-discuss-what-they-are-used-for) (`:after`) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class `clearfix` to it. Then apply this CSS:

```css
.clearfix:after {
  content: ' ';
  visibility: hidden;
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
}
```

Alternatively, give `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.


#### Q. Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
A Block Formatting Context (BFC) is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. Floats, absolutely positioned elements, `inline-blocks`, `table-cells`, `table-caption`s, and elements with `overflow` other than `visible` (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.

A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:

* The value of `float` is not `none`.
* The value of `position` is neither `static` nor `relative`.
* The value of `display` is `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `inline-block`, `flex`, or `inline-flex`.
* The value of `overflow` is not `visible`.

In a BFC, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).

Vertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a BFC collapse. 


#### Q. What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context? How works .clearfix?

* Empty `div` method - `<div style="clear:both;"></div>`.
* Clearfix method - Refer to the `.clearfix` class above.
* `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` method - Parent will establish a new block formatting context and expand to contains its floated children.

In large projects, I would write a utility `.clearfix` class and use them in places where I need it. `overflow: hidden` might clip children if the children is taller than the parent and is not very ideal.

#### Q. Does ```overflow: hidden``` create a new block formatting context?
* Yes. overflow property deals with the content if content size exceeds the allocated size for the content. You can make extra content visible, hidden, scroll or auto (viewport default behavior).

#### Q. How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?

* After identifying the issue and the offending browser, use a separate style sheet that only loads when that specific browser is being used. This technique requires server-side rendering though.
* Use `autoprefixer` to automatically add vendor prefixes to your code.
* Use Reset CSS or Normalize.css.

Example: 01
```css
.box-shadow {
  background-color: red;
  background-image: url(gradient-slice.png);
  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top right, #A60000, #FFFFFF); /*Chrome and Safari*/
  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top right, #A60000, #FFFFFF); 	  /*Firefox*/
  background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(top right, #A60000, #FFFFFF);     /*Internet Explorer*/
  background-image: -o-linear-gradient(top right, #A60000, #FFFFFF);      /*Opera*/
  background-image: linear-gradient(top right, #A60000, #FFFFFF);
}

/*Example: 02*/

.box {
	-moz-border-radius: 15px;    /* Firefox */
	-webkit-border-radius: 15px; /* Safari and Chrome */
	border-radius: 15px; /* Opera 10.5+, future browsers, and now also Internet Explorer 6+ using IE-CSS3 */
}
```

#### Q. What are your favorite image replacement techniques and which do you use when?

* lazy loading.
* progressive image loading placeholders.


#### Q. How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?


* Graceful degradation - The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.
* Progressive enhancement - The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.
* Use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to check for feature support.
* Autoprefixer for automatic vendor prefix insertion.
* Feature detection using [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/).
* Use CSS Feature queries [@support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)


#### Q. What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?

These techniques are related to accessibility (a11y).

* `visibility: hidden`. However, the element is still in the flow of the page, and still takes up space.
* `width: 0; height: 0`. Make the element not take up any space on the screen at all, resulting in not showing it.
* `position: absolute; left: -99999px`. Position it outside of the screen.
* `text-indent: -9999px`. This only works on text within the `block` elements.
* Metadata. For example by using Schema.org, RDF, and JSON-LD.
* WAI-ARIA. A W3C technical specification that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages.

Even if WAI-ARIA is the ideal solution, I would go with the `absolute` positioning approach, as it has the least caveats, works for most elements and it's an easy technique.


#### Q. How could you apply css rules specific to a media?

* ```@media (max-width: 700px){...}``` means you want to apply rules to those media whose max-width is 700 px. this means every smaller device will have this rule.

```@media (max-width: 700px) and (orientation: landscape){...}``` will apply rules for media smaller than 700px and in landscape orientation.


#### Q. What is the use of ```@media only screen```?

* hide style sheets from older user agents.


#### Q. Does the ```screen``` keyword apply to the device's physical screen or the browser's viewport?

* Browser's Viewport


#### Q. Are you familiar with styling SVG?

Yes, there are several ways to color shapes (including specifying attributes on the object) using inline CSS, an embedded CSS section, or an external CSS file. Most SVG you'll find around the web use inline CSS, but there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each type.

Basic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: `fill` and `stroke`. `fill` sets the color inside the object and `stroke` sets the color of the line drawn around the object. You can use the same CSS color naming schemes that you use in HTML, whether that's color names (that is `red`), RGB values (that is `rgb(255,0,0)`), Hex values, RGBA values, etc.

```html
<rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" stroke="blue" 
  fill="purple" fill-opacity="0.5" stroke-opacity="0.8"/>
```


#### Q. Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?

Yes, there are four types of @media properties (including _screen_):

* `all` - for all media type devices
* `print` - for printers
* `speech` - for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud
* `screen` - for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.

Here is an example of `print` media type's usage:

```css
@media print {
  body {
    color: black;
  }
}
```


#### Q. How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?

Use `@font-face` and define `font-family` for different `font-weight`s.


#### Q. Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector?

This part is related to the above about [writing efficient CSS](#what-are-some-of-the-gotchas-for-writing-efficient-css). Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.

For example with this selector `p span`, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element. For a particular `<span>`, as soon as it finds a `<p>`, it knows that the `<span>` matches and can stop its matching.


#### Q. What are the some pseudo classed u have used?

* pseudo class tells you specific state of an element. allow to style element dynamically. The most popular one is ```:hover```. Besides i have used :visited, ```:focus```, ```:nth-child```, ```nth-of-type```, ```:link```, etc.

* pseudo classes is better if you don't want to mess up with javaScript however, pseudo-classes is slow to process and apply rules.


#### Q. How do you optimize css selectors?

* This is very open and depend on what you are trying to achieve. If i order selectors in terms of render speed it would be like id, class, tag, siblings, child, descendant, universal, attribute, pseudo. Speed of ID and class is very close. However your code should be readable, maintainable and DRY along with highly performant.

* The best practices in general are: avoid universal selectors, don't repeat yourself, remove redundant selectors, be as specific as possible, and keep learning.


#### Q. How can you load css resources conditionally?

```@import``` allows you to load/import stylesheet by using a path (uri) representing the location of the file. You can define one or more media by comma separation for which you want to load the stylesheet. If browser dont support the media stylesheet will not be loaded.


#### Q. Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). They can be used for decoration (`:first-line`, `:first-letter`) or adding elements to the markup (combined with `content: ...`) without having to modify the markup (`:before`, `:after`).

* `:first-line` and `:first-letter` can be used to decorate text.
* Used in the `.clearfix` hack as shown above to add a zero-space element with `clear: both`.
* Triangular arrows in tooltips use `:before` and `:after`. Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM. It's not really possible to draw a triangle with just CSS styles without using an additional HTML element.


#### Q. What are the properties related to box model?

* Technically, height, width, padding and border are part of box model and margin is related to it.

* Everything in a web page is a box where you can control size, position, background, etc. Each box/ content area is optionally surrounded by padding, border and margin. When you set height and width of an element, you set content height and width.



#### Q. What does  ```* { box-sizing: border-box; }``` do? What are its advantages?
* Make every element in the document include the padding and border in the element's inner dimensions; 
    making it easier to reason about the layout of elements on the page.

* By default, elements have `box-sizing: content-box` applied, and only the content size is being accounted for.
* `box-sizing: border-box` changes how the `width` and `height` of elements are being calculated, `border` and `padding` are also being included in the calculation.
* The `height` of an element is now calculated by the content's `height` + vertical `padding` + vertical `border` width.
* The `width` of an element is now calculated by the content's `width` + horizontal `padding` + horizontal `border` width.
* Taking into account `padding`s and `border`s as part of our box model resonates better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.


#### Q. List as many values for the display property that you can remember.

* `none`, `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`, `list-item`.


#### Q. Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?

* Flexbox or Flexible boxes, is a new layout mode in CSS3 Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

* For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents.

* Grid specs CSS Grid Layout is a specification for creating two-dimensional grids Grid is a companion to the Flexible Box Module (flexbox). Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, so things can be arranged in an unbroken line. Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout, meaning the items don't need to sit next to each other. In the future we're likely to use both: Grid Layout for main page areas, and flexbox for the smaller UI elements it excels with.


#### Q. How is responsive design different from adaptive design? What is responsive design? What is the difference between fixed and fluid layouts? What are some of the pros and cons with these designs?

Both responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on.

Responsive design works on the principle of flexibility - a single fluid website that can look good on any device. Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.

Adaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device. Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you'd have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.


#### Q. Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use? What kind of techniques do you use to handle images for retina screens?

_Retina_ is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices _retina_ defacto displays.

Browsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.

In order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.

To overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5. It requires making available different resolution files of the same image to the browser and let it decide which image is best, using the html attribute `srcset` and optionally `sizes`, for instance:

```html
<div responsive-background-image>  
  <img src="/images/test-1600.jpg"
    sizes="
      (min-width: 768px) 50vw,
      (min-width: 1024px) 66vw,
      100vw"
    srcset="
      /images/test-400.jpg 400w,
      /images/test-800.jpg 800w,
      /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w">
</div>
```

It is important to note that browsers which don't support HTML5's `srcset` (i.e. IE11) will ignore it and use `src` instead. If we really need to support IE11 and we want to provide this feature for performance reasons, we can use a JavaScript polyfill, e.g. Picturefill (link in the references).

For icons, I would also opt to use SVGs and icon fonts where possible, as they render very crisply regardless of resolution.


#### Q. Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?
`translate()` is a value of CSS `transform`. Changing `transform` or `opacity` does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers `reflow`. `transform` causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence `translate()` is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.

When using `translate()`, the element still occupies its original space (sort of like `position: relative`), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.


#### Q. The translate() function can move the position of an element on the z-axis.
* False

#### Q. Tell what each of these tags do, if there are alternatives, which are preferable, why?
```html
<em>
<b>
<abbr>
<nav>
<i>
<j>
<link>
<strong>
<article>
```    

#### Q. What is At-Rule?
* An at-rule is an instruction given in a CSS document using the ```@``` character. An at-rule could have a declaration block or a simple string of text. The example below has two different at-rules:
```css
@import url(secondary.css);

@media print {
  #container {
    width: 500px;
  }
}
```
The at-rule is not just the ```@media``` or ```@import``` part at the beginning; the entire instruction comprises the complete at-rule.


#### Q. What is Combinator selector?

* A combinator is the character in a selector that connects two selectors together. There are four types of combinators. These four combinators help create descendant selectors (with a space character), child selectors (with the ```>``` character), adjacent sibling selectors (with the ```+``` character), and general sibling selectors (with the ```~``` character). To dispel any confusion, here are those four combinators in use:
```css
/*  In all 4 examples */
/*  whatever appears between "div" and "p" is a combinator */
/*  in the first example, the combinator is a space character */
div p {
  color: #222;
}

div>p {
  color: #333;
}

div+p {
  color: #444;
}

div~p {
  color: #555;
}
```


#### Q. What is RuleSet?
* A rule set is a single section of CSS including the selector, the curly braces, and the different lines with properties and values. The code in the example below comprises one rule set:

```css
/*  the rule set starts with the line below */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #555;
  font-size: 14px;
}
/*  ends with the closing curly brace above */
```


#### Q. Provide CSS so that three lines are displayed red, then green, then blue (2):
```html
<div class="rgb">
    <span>Red</span>
    <span>Green<b>Blue</b></span>
</div>
```

#### Q. Provided following HTML and CSS, what will be displayed (1)?
```css
<div class="red">Hi, I'm Blue</div>

div.red { color: green; }
div { font-weight: bold; }
.red { color: yellow; font-weight: normal; }
```

#### Q. What is Universal Selector?

* The universal selector matches any element within the context in which it’s placed in a selector. 
    In the example below, the ```*``` character is the universal selector:
```css
/*  the asterisk character is the universal selector */
.navigation *ul {
  width: 100px;
  float: left;
}
```

* So, any element that appears as a child descendant of the unordered list element inside an element that has a class of “navigation” will receive the declared styles.

* Universal selectors are generally discouraged for performance reasons.


#### Q. How can the gap under the image be removed?
* As images being inline elements are treated same as texts, so there is a gap left, which can be   removed by:
```css
img { display: block ; }
```

#### Q. What is graceful degradation?
* In case the component fails, it will continue to work properly in the presence of a graceful degradation.
     The latest browser application is used when a webpage is designed. As it is not available to everyone,
      there is a basic functionality, which enables its use to a wider audience. 
    In case the image is unavailable for viewing, text is shown with the alt tag.


#### Q. What is progressive enhancement?
* It’s an alternative to graceful degradation, which concentrates on the matter of the web. 
    The functionality is same, but it provides an extra edge to users having the latest bandwidth. 
    It has been into prominent use recently with mobile internet connections expanding their base.


#### Q. What is progressive rendering?

* Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve the performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible.

* It used to be much more prevalent in the days before broadband internet but it is still used in modern development as mobile data connections are becoming increasingly popular (and unreliable)!

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33651166/what-is-progressive-rendering

* Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve the performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible.

* It used to be much more prevalent in the days before broadband internet but it is still used in modern development as mobile data connections are becoming increasingly popular (and unreliable)!

* Examples of such techniques:

    * Lazy loading of images - Images on the page are not loaded all at once. JavaScript will be used to load an image when the user scrolls into the part of the page that displays the image.

    * Prioritizing visible content (or above-the-fold rendering) - Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the users browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred scripts or listen for the DOMContentLoaded/load event to load in other resources and content.

    * Async HTML fragments - Flushing parts of the HTML to the browser as the page is constructed on the back end.
    

#### Q. What is an ```iframe``` and how it works?

* An ```iframe``` is an HTML document which can be embedded inside another HTML page.

* The IFrame HTML element is often used to insert content from another source, such as an advertisement, into a Web page.

```css
<iframe src="https://github.com" height="300px" width="300px"></iframe>
```

#### Q. What is mobile-first? Can you explain the difference between coding a website to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?

Making a website responsive means the some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device's screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries, for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.

```css
@media (min-width: 601px) {
  .my-class {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .my-class {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}
```

A mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the previous example:

```css
.my-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .my-class {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

A mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:

* It's more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied for them don't have to be validated against any media queries.
* It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.

#### Q. What does Accessibility (a11y) mean?
Accessibility (a11y) is a measure of a computer system's accessibility is to all people, including those with disabilities or impairments. It concerns both software and hardware and how they are configured in order to enable a disabled or impaired person to use that computer system successfully.

Accessibility is also known as assistive technology.


#### Q. What is accessibility & ARIA role means in a web application?
Accessibility means letting the user navigate and interact with a website by any means. Let it be a keyboard, a mouse or people with disabilities or impairments.


* ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Application.
* ARIA is a spec from W3C.
* ARIA is created to improve accessibility in web applications.
* ARIA provides a extra information to screen readers via HTML attributes.
* ARIA doesn't affect how an element is rendered in a browser.


#### Q. What is UI/UX?
**UI or User Interface**:  is how a product or website is laid out and how you interact with it: Where the buttons are, how big the fonts are, and how menus are organized are all elements of UI.

**UX or User Experience**: is how you feel about using a product or a website. So, your love for the way the new Apple Watch looks or your excitement that there’s finally a tablet-sized iPhone to watch those Corgi videos you’re obsessed with are reflections of UX.
So the new look of the Facebook news feed involves a change to UI, and the way you navigate that new page is the UX. 

#### Q. What is semantic?
Semantic HTML, or "semantically-correct HTML", is HTML where the tags used to structure content are selected and applied appropriately to the meaning of the content.

For example, <b></b> (for bold), and <i></i> (for italic) should never be used, because they’re to do with formatting, not with the meaning or structure of the content. Instead, use the replacements <strong></strong> and <em></em> (meaning emphasis), which by default will turn text bold and italic (but don’t have to do so in all browsers), while adding meaning to the structure of the content

#### Q. Why you would like to use semantic tag. Why Semantic HTML is Important?
* Search Engine Optimization, accessibility, repurposing, light code. 

* Many visually impaired person rely on browser speech and semantic tag helps to interpret page content clearly.

* Search engine needs to understand page content to rank and semantic tag helps.

* semantic code aids accessibility. Specially, many people whose eyes are not good rely on speech browsers to read pages to them. These programs cannot interpret pages very well unless they are clearly explained.

* Help Search engines to better understand pages. Search engine need to understand what your content is about when rank you properly on search engines. Semantic code tends to improve your placement on search engines, as it is easier for the "search engine spiders" to understand.

* It’s easier to read and edit, which saves time and money during maintenance.


#### Q. Which of listed CSS properties are inherited?
* position
* font-size
* color
* background-color


#### Q. Which property is used to change the face of a font?
* The font-family property is used to change the face of a font.


#### Q. Which property is used to make a font italic or oblique?
* The font-style property is used to make a font italic or oblique.


#### Q. Which property is used to create a small-caps effect?
* The font-variant property is used to create a small-caps effect.


#### Q. Which property is used to increase or decrease how bold or light a font appears?
* The font-weight property is used to increase or decrease how bold or light a font appears.


#### Q. Which property is used to add or subtract space between the letters that make up a word?
* The letter-spacing property is used to add or subtract space between the letters that make up a word.


#### Q. Which property is used to add or subtract space between the words of a sentence?
* The word-spacing property is used to add or subtract space between the words of a sentence.


#### Q. Which property is used to indent the text of a paragraph?
* The text-indent property is used to indent the text of a paragraph.


#### Q. Which property is used to align the text of a document?
* The text-align property is used to align the text of a document.

* ```text-align: center``` will do the horizontal alignment but vertical-align: middle will not work here. there are couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are positioning. You make the parent as relative position and child as absolute positioning. And then define all position parameter as sero and width 50% and height 30% (sounds messy look at the example and read ref) 


#### Q. Which property is used to underline, overline, and strikethrough text?
* The text-decoration property is used to underline, overline, and strikethrough text.


#### Q. Which property is used to capitalize text or convert text to uppercase or lowercase letters?
* The text-transform property is used to capitalize text or convert text to uppercase or lowercase letters.


#### Q. Which property allows you to control the shape or appearance of the marker of a list?
* The list-style-type allows you to control the shape or appearance of the marker.


#### Q. How do I restore the default value of a property?
* Initially CSS didn't provide a "default" keyword and the only way to restore the default value of a property is to explicitly re-declare that property
    This has changed with CSS 2; the keyword 'initial' is now a valid value for a CSS property. 
    It resets it to its default value, which is defined in the CSS specification of the given property.


#### Q. How do I assign multiple classes to an element?
* HTML elements can be assigned multiple classes by listing the classes in the class attribute, with a blank space to separate them.
```html
<style type="text/css">
.news { background: black; color: white; }
.today { font-weight: bold; }
</style>

<div class="news today">
... content of today's news ...
</div>
```

#### Q. What is specificity? How do u calculate specificity?
* A process of determining which css rule will be applied to an element. it actually determines which rules will take precedence.

* inline style usually wins then ID then class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), universal selector (*) has no specificity.


#### Q. What is selector specificity (selector importance) and how it works? How do u calculate specificity?
ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.

```css
/*wins*/
a#a-02 { background-image : url(n.gif); }
a[id="a-02"] { background-image : url(n.png); }
```

Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element selector.
The embedded style sheet is closer to the element to be styled.
The last rule defined overrides any previous, conflicting rules.

```css
p { color: red; background: yellow }
p { color: green } // wins
```

A class selector beats any number of element selectors.

```css
.introduction {} //wins
html body div div h2 p {}
```

The universal selector has a specificity of 0, 0, 0, 0.


#### Q. What do you know about transition?
* transition allows to add an effect while changing from one style to another. You can set the which property you want to transition, duration, how you want to transit (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, cubic-bezier) and delay when transition will start. you can transition more than one property by comma separation


#### What are the different css filter you can use?
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/filter

* css filter allows to render DOM element, image, or video. u can choose from: grayscale, blur, opacity, brightness, contrast.


#### Q. Enlist the various fonts properties?
* font-style
* font-variant
* font-weight
* font-size/line-height
* font-family
* caption
* icon


#### Q. Describe Floats and Flexbox and how each works. Why Flexbox is a better solution for web layouts?
    
* ```Floats``` specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, 
    where text and inline elements will wrap around it.
    
* ```Flexbox``` consists of flex containers and flex items. Flex containers wrap a set of flex items and define how they are laid out. 
    Flex items has properites that define how they interact with sibling flex elements and can also be flex containers themselves.


#### Q. What is the difference between ```em``` and ```rem``` units?

Both em and rem units are based on the font-size CSS property. The only difference is where they inherit their values from.

* ```em``` units inherit their value from the font-size of the parent element
* ```rem``` units inherit their value from the font-size of the root element (html)

In most browsers, the font-size of the root element is set to 16px by default.


#### Q. What is the difference between ```span``` and ```div```?

```div``` is a block element and ```span``` is inline element.

It is illegal to put block element inside inline element. div can have a p tag and a p tag can have a span. However, span can't have a div or p tag inside.


#### Q. What does !important mean in CSS?
* It overrides the cascade and gives the style rule the highest precedence.


#### Q. What are optional closing tag? and why would u use it?
```p, li, td, tr, th, html, body```, etc. you don't have to provide end tag. Whenever browser hits a new tag it automatically ends the previous tag. However, you have to be careful to escape it.


#### Q. What is a self closing tag?

In HTML5 it is not strictly necessary to close certain HTML tags. The tags that aren’t required to have specific closing tags are called “self closing” tags.

An example of a self closing tag is something like a line break (```<br />```) or the meta tag (```<meta>```). This means that the following are both acceptable:

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
...
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

#### Q. How can u highlight text in html?

use mark element.

```html
<p>Some part of this paragraph is <mark>highlighted</mark> by using mark element.</p>
```

#### Q. Does the following trigger http request at the time of page load?
```html
<img src="mypic.jpg" style="visibility: hidden" alt="My photo">

<div style="display: none;">
    <img src="mypic.jpg" alt="My photo">
</div>
```

* Yes


#### Q. Does style2.css have to be downloaded and parsed before Paragraph 1 is rendered on the page?
```html
<head>
    <link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    <link href="style2.css" rel="stylesheet">
</body>
```

* Yes


#### Q. Does style1.css have to be downloaded and parsed before style2.css can be fetched?
```html
<head>
    <link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="style2.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```

* No

#### Q. Can u apply css rule to a part of html document?
yes. by using "scopped" in the style tag.

#### Q. What are some rules for writing efficient CSS?      
Firstly, understand that browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector. Hence avoid key selectors that are tag and universal selectors. They match a large number of elements and browsers will have to do more work in determining if the parents do match.

[BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://bem.info/) methodology recommends that everything has a single class, and, where you need hierarchy, that gets baked into the name of the class as well, this naturally makes the selector efficient and easy to override.

Be aware of which CSS properties trigger reflow, repaint, and compositing. Avoid writing styles that change the layout (trigger reflow) where possible.


#### SASS basic concepts
* **Variables**: Variables in SASS start with $ sign
* **Nesting**: CSS lacks visual hierarchy while working with child selectors. You have to write selectors and their combinations in separate lines. Nesting provides a visual hierarchy as in the HTML and increases the readability.
* **mixins**: mixins are used to include a bunch of properties or group declarations together. It allows for the easy reuse of blocks of code. Use include to
* **Inheritance**: extends are useful for sharing a generic definition with selectors rather than copying it in.
* If/Else Statements and loops
* **import**: separating your codes in small pieces is helpful for expressing your declarations and increasing maintainability and control over the codebase.
* **Math operations**: can be used for standard arithmetic or unit conversions.

#### Q. Explain the @include, @mixin, @function functions and how they are used. What is %placeholder?
    
* ```@mixin``` A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site

```css
@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
          border-radius: $radius;
}
```

```css
.box { @include border-radius(10px); }
```

* ```@extend``` directive provides a simple way to allow a selector to inherit/extend the styles of another one.
```css
.message {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: red;
}
```
        

```%placeholder``` are classes that aren’t output when your SCSS is compiled
```css
%awesome {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
body {
    @extend %awesome;
}
p {
    @extend %awesome;
}
```

```css
/* Output */
body, p {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

#### Q. What are the CSS positioning?

|Keyword    | Value                 |Description                                                                           |
|:----------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|position 	|static 				|The default mode, block element is positioned in the flow. Top, left etc. are ignored.|
|position 	|relative 				|The block element is positioned relative to its position in the flow.                 |
|position 	|absolute 				|Block element is positioned relative to its container.                                |
|position 	|fixed 					|Block element is positioned relative to the window and won’t scroll.                  |
|top 		|Number [px, cm, in…] 	|Positions the block down from the reference point at the specified distance.          |
|bottom 	|Number [px, cm, in…] 	|Positions the block up from the reference point at the specified distance.            |
|left 		|Number [px, cm, in…] 	|Positions the block right from the reference point at the specified distance.         |
|right 		|Number [px, cm, in…] 	|Positions the block left from the reference point at the specified distance.          |
